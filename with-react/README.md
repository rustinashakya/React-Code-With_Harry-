<!-- Learning React -->

<!-- Why react ?? -->
- We cam use states which means that once we update the   state variable, it changes across the page
- We can split our app into multiple components and reuse those components
- React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update the UI, which is better than updating content using DOM manupulation
- Debugging and maintainance is easy 

<!-- node modules -->
- this folder has all the react packages and everything of react

<!-- public -->
-  All the files we want to make available directly is kept in public folder
